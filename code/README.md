# portfolio

Technigo Bootcamp's 8th week's project is to make your own portfolio.

"The portfolio should feature projects you have built so far and some information about yourself and your background, and - if you'd like - your contact details.

The portfolio will be a great test of your HTML and CSS skills but we will also take the opporitunity to get started with accessibility and build websites for 
everyone â€“ something every frontender should know.
